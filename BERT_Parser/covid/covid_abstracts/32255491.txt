Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major enzyme responsible for conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1-7). It also acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, which causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19. In recognition of the importance of ACE2 and to celebrate 20 years since its discovery, the journal will publish a focused issue on the basic science and (patho)physiological role of this multifunctional protein.
