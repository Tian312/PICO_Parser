With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital. This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.
