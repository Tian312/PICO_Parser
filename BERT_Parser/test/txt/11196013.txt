Spatial orientation adjustments in children with autism in Hong Kong . Abnormal spatial orientation and body postures in children with autism often interfere with visual abilities to attend tasks and social interactions . Twenty-four children diagnosed with autism from Kowloon , Hong Kong were assessed for spatial orientation and spatial management abilities . Positive changes in spatial orientation were evident when the children wore ambient prism lenses and included changes in posture from slanted to erect . Adjustments in spatial management were evident in improved ball catching ability , a task requiring visual tracking and eye-hand coordination . The findings suggest that alterations to the sensory systems may lead to behavioral change in some children .
