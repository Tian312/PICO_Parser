Comparison of electromotive drug administration with ketorolac or with placebo in patients with pain from rheumatic disease : a double-masked study . This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of ketorolac compared with placebo when delivered by electromotive drug administration ( EMDA ) in patients with pain from rheumatic disease . In EMDA , or iontophoresis , a low-intensity electric current is applied over the skin to deliver medication into body tissues . Although EMDA has been used to treat patients with various diseases , controlled studies are lacking in patients with rheumatic disease . This double-masked study included 60 patients ( 43 women and 17 men ) aged 31 to 80 years with the following conditions : 12 , epicondylitis ; 30 , scapulohumeral periarthritis ; 10 , gonalgia ; and 8 , metatarsalgia . They were divided randomly by a physician into 2 groups of 30 patients each for 5 sessions of active treatment ( 30 mg of ketorolac ) or placebo ( 5 mL of normal saline ) . Treatment took place every other day for 20 minutes . Immediately before and after the five treatment sessions and 7 days after treatment ended , both patient and physician measured the degree of pain using a categoric scale ( no pain , slight pain , intermediate pain , strong pain , and very strong pain ) and evaluated pain intensity using the Scott and Huskisson Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Seven days after treatment ended , both physician and patient judged the result of treatment using a second categoric scale ( no improvement or intermediate , good , or very good result ) . Both ketorolac and placebo provided immediate , significant pain relief when delivered by EMDA , but only those patients receiving ketorolac experienced a further reduction in pain 7 days after treatment ; those receiving placebo experienced a slight increase in pain . VAS values differed significantly between the two groups . Poor results ( no improvement ) were significantly higher in the placebo-treated group , while good results were significantly higher in the ketorolac-treated group . No patient reported any adverse effects during treatment . This study demonstrates that ketorolac relieves pain when delivered by EMDA and offers longer-lasting pain relief than does placebo .
