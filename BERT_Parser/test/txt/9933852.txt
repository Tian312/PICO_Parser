Erythropoiesis after therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin : a dose-response study in anemic cancer surgery patients . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Preoperative treatment with 600 U/kg of recombinant human erythropoietin ( r-HuEPO ) effectively increases erythropoiesis in cancer patients . The aim of this study was to evaluate the erythropoietic response after different doses of r-HuEPO in order to find the minimum effective dose . MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty anemic sideropenic patients ( hemoglobin < /=110 g/l ; serum iron < 600 microg/l ) with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract were randomly allocated to two groups : the first ( n = 10 ) received 400 U/kg of r-Hu EPO divided in 4 doses ( 100 U/kg each , every 4 days ) ; the second ( n = 10 ) received 200 U/kg of r-HuEPO ( 50 U/kg each , every 4 days ) . Both groups were given intravenous iron gluconate ( 125 mg ) every day for 15 days . RESULTS After treatment , the serum iron level significantly rose in both groups . The production of new red blood cells was 176.3+/-90.8 ml in the 200 U/kg group and 268.4+/-79.4 ml in the 400 U/kg group ( p = 0.036 ) . The increase of hemoglobin was significantly higher in the 400 U/kg group ( 22.3+/-2.0 g/l ) than in the 200 U/kg group ( 14.1+/-2.7 g/l ) ( p = 0.017 ) . CONCLUSION The r-HuEPO dose of 400 U/kg appears significantly more effective than the 200 U/kg to stimulate erythropoiesis in anemic sideropenic cancer patients .
