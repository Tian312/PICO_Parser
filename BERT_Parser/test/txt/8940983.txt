The immunogenicity of three Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccines after a primary vaccination series in Philippine infants . Serum antibody responses to three Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ( PRP-OMP , PRP-T , and HbOC ) were evaluated in 174 Philippine infants after a primary vaccination series . Children were randomized to receive one of the Hib vaccines ( Hib groups ) or into a control group . Vaccination was carried out at six , 10 and 14 weeks of age based on the local Expanded Program of Immunization schedule . Sera were collected at six weeks of age for the Hib groups and one month after the third dose for all subjects . Anti-Hib concentrations were determined by the Farr-type radioimmunoassay . There were no significant differences ( P = 0.3626 ) in the prevaccination anti-Hib geometric mean concentration ( GMC ) among the three Hib groups . Differences in the GMC after the primary series of three doses were significant ( P < 0.0001 ) ; GMC was highest for PRP-T ( 6.62 micrograms/ml ) , followed by HbOC ( 1.9 micrograms/ml ) , then PRP-OMP ( 1.06 micrograms/ml ) , and lowest for the control group ( 0.11 microgram/ml ) . We conclude that all three Hib conjugate vaccines ( PRP-T , HbOC , and PRP-OMP ) were immunogenic after three primary doses among Philippine infants .
