Is hands-on experience more effective than didactic workshops in postgraduate cancer pain education ? BACKGROUND This study examined the nurse outcomes of a cancer pain education program for nurses of patients from 11 different ethnic groups . METHODS Four hundred ninety six home , hospital , and hospice nurses participated in a one-day workshop or two half-day workshops on cancer pain assessment and management . Of these , 116 were randomized to participate in a bedside-precepted visit with an oncology nurse specialist with pain specialization and a focus group to discuss attitudinal issues . Eighty-six nurses served as controls . Pre- , post- and one-year follow-up tests were administered . RESULTS Attitudes , knowledge , and application skills significantly improved for workshop-only and enriched-model nurses relative to controls . CONCLUSION For postgraduate nurses , daylong cancer pain education workshops were , in the group studied , as effective as hands-on experience in improving cancer pain knowledge and changing attitudes . Both the workshop-only and the enriched-model nurses relative to controls had significantly improved knowledge and changed attitudes towards optimal pain management .
