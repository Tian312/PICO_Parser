Modulation of oxidant stress in vivo in chronic cigarette smokers . BACKGROUND Free radical-induced oxidative damage is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with cigarette smoking . We examined the production of 8-epi-prostaglandin ( PG ) F2 alpha , a stable product of lipid peroxidation in vivo , and its modulation by aspirin and antioxidant vitamins in chronic cigarette smokers . METHODS AND RESULTS We performed the following studies : ( 1 ) a cross-sectional comparison of smokers and control subjects , ( 2 ) an examination of the dose-response relationship , ( 3 ) an exploration of the effect of smoking cessation ( 3 weeks ) and nicotine patch supplementation , ( 4 ) the effect of aspirin consumption , and ( 5 ) the effects of 5 days ' dosing with vitamin E ( 100 and 800 U ) , vitamin C ( 2 g ) , and their combination . 8-epi-PGF2 alpha excretion ( in pmol/mmol , mean +/- SEM ) was 176.5+/-30.6 in heavy smokers , 92.7+/-4.8 ( P < .05 ) in moderate smokers , and 54.1+/-2.7 ( P < .005 ) in nonsmokers . Urinary levels fell from 145.5+/-24.9 to 114.6+/-27.1 ( week 2 , P < .05 ) and 112.6+/-24.9 ( week 3 , P < .05 ) on cessation of smoking . Aspirin treatment failed to suppress urinary levels of 8-epi-PGF2 alpha despite a significant reduction in urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2 production and suppression of 8-epi-PGF2 alpha and TxB2 in serum . Vitamin C ( pre , 194.6+/-40.9 ; post , 137.2+/-34.1 ; P < .05 ) and a combination of vitamin C and E ( pre , 171.0+/-39.8 ; post , 133.5+/-29.6 P < .05 ) suppressed urinary 8-epi-PGF2 alpha , whereas vitamin E alone had no effect . CONCLUSIONS Urinary 8-epi-PGF2 alpha may represent a noninvasive , quantitative index of oxidant stress in vivo . Elevated levels of 8-epi-PGF2 alpha in smokers may be modulated by quitting cigarettes and switching to nicotine patches or by antioxidant vitamin therapy .
