Thoracoscopic talc insufflation versus talc slurry for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion . BACKGROUND Talc has been generally accepted to be the most effective sclerosant for chemical pleurodesis , although the optimal route of administration remains unclear . METHODS We designed a prospective , randomized study to compare video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation with bedside talc slurry in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion . From September 1993 to November 1995 , 57 patients were recruited and randomized to either video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation under general anesthesia ( n = 28 ) or talc slurry by the bedside ( n = 29 ) . Patients with poor general condition ( Karnofsky score less than 30 % ) , poor pulmonary function ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 0.5 L ) , or trapped lungs were excluded from this study . Five grams of purified talc was used for either video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation or talc slurry . RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients with respect to age , sex ratio , chest drainage duration , postprocedural hospital stay , parenteral narcotics requirement , complications , or procedure failure ( ie , recurrence ) . CONCLUSIONS Video-assisted thoracoscopic talc insufflation has not been shown to be a superior approach compared with talc slurry in our study . Because the former demands more resources , we advocate that talc slurry should be considered as the procedure of choice in the treatment of symptomatic malignant pleural effusion in patients who do not have trapped lungs .
