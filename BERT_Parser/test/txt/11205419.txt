Cognitive performance and serotonergic function in users of ecstasy . RATIONALE ( +/- ) 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or ecstasy ) has been shown to cause long term damage to serotonergic cerebral neurons in animals . The neurotoxic effects in humans are less clear and little is known about the functional consequences , although some studies suggest memory impairment . Given the widespread use of MDMA , our lack of knowledge raises concerns . OBJECTIVE We investigated , in humans , the relation between past use of ecstasy and cognitive performance as well as serotonergic function . METHODS Two groups of 21 males with moderate and heavy recreational use of MDMA , respectively , and a control group of 20 males without use of MDMA were compared . All were from the same subculture . Reaction time , direct recall , and recognition were assessed . Serotonergic function was measured by the neuro-endocrine response to a placebo-controlled , crossover challenge with dexfenfluramine . RESULTS Ecstasy users showed a broad pattern of statistically significant , but clinically small , impairment of memory and prolonged reaction times . Heavy users were affected stronger than moderate users . Release of cortisol but not of prolactin after dexfenfluramine administration was significantly reduced in both groups of ecstasy users compared with the controls . Analyses of covariance showed that likely confounding variables including recent exposure to ecstasy , psychosocial profiles and use of other drugs did not explain the differences found between the groups . CONCLUSIONS These results provide further evidence that use of ecstasy may be associated with impairment of memory and of serotonergic function . These findings are compatible with neurotoxicity of ecstasy as shown in animals .
