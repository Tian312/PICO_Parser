Unopposed estrogen increases total plasma factor VII , but not active factor VII -- a short-term placebo-controlled study in healthy postmenopausal women . Estrogen therapy may increase the risk of arterial thromboembolism , at least in the short term . In a randomized , double-blind and placebo-controlled study in 25 healthy postmenopausal women ( 52.5 +/- 2.8 years ) , we therefore examined the short-term effect of unopposed estrogen on the fasting and fat-load-stimulated plasma levels of total factor VII versus active factor VII . Plasma total factor VII was measured by use of a chromogenic assay ; plasma active FVII by a recently developed method using truncated tissue factor . As compared to placebo , 8 weeks of oral 17beta-estradiol ( 2 mg daily ) increased the mean fasting and postprandial plasma levels of total factor VII by 17 and 21 % points , respectively ( both P < 0.01 ) , but did not affect the fasting and/or postprandial plasma levels of active factor VII ( mean change both 0.05 ng/mL ; P > 0.35 ) . Furthermore , the change in the fasting level of total factor VII after therapy was not associated with the change in the fasting level of active factor VII ( r = 0.27 ; P = 0.21 ) . These findings argue against the idea that elevated levels of total factor VII underlie an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism in postmenopausal women using unopposed estrogen replacement .
