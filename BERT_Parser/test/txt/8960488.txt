Dental bacteremia in children . Bacteremia resulting from dental extraction is regarded as an important cause of bacterial endocarditis , and it is therefore recommended that patients undergoing tooth extraction be given prophylactic antibiotics . As dental procedures other than extractions may also cause bacteremias , we studied a variety of dental procedures routinely used in pediatric dentistry . Blood samples for cultures were obtained 30 s after each of 13 dental operative procedures in 735 anesthetized children aged 2-16 years . Four procedures used for conservative dentistry caused bacteremias significantly more often than the baseline value of 9.4 % : polishing teeth 24.5 % , intraligamental injection 96.6 % , rubber dam placement 29.4 % , and matrix band with wedge placement 32.1 % . In comparison , toothbrushing alone caused a bacteremia on 38.5 % of occasions . The organisms isolated were typical of odontogenic bacteremias in that 50 % of the isolates were identified as varieties of viridans streptococci . These data show that a wider variety of dental procedures than was previously documented cause bacteremia .
