A randomised open multicentre comparative trial of lamotrigine and carbamazepine as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent epilepsy . The efficacy and safety of lamotrigine and carbamazepine as monotherapy in patients with untreated , newly diagnosed or recurrent partial and/or generalised tonic-clonic seizures , were compared in a randomised , open , multicentre study . Patients received 24 weeks ' treatment with oral lamotrigine 100 mg ( LTG 100 , n = 115 ) or 200 mg ( LTG 200 , n = 111 ) or carbamazepine 600 mg ( CBZ 600 , n = 117 ) . Efficacy measurements were comparable between the three treatment groups , although the higher lamotrigine dose was possibly most effective , with 60.4 % completing seizure free compared with 51.3 % ( LTG 100 ) and 54.7 % ( CBZ 600 ) . Both dosage regimens of lamotrigine were well tolerated . More patients on CBZ 600 reported adverse experiences , 66 % versus 53 % ( LTG 100 ) and 58 % ( LTG 200 ) , and of these a greater proportion were attributed to CBZ 600 treatment , 53 % versus 23 % ( LTG 100 ) and 28 % ( LTG 200 ) . Similarly , a greater proportion of the CBZ 600 group required a change in dose , 47 % versus 20 % ( LTG 100 ) and 17 % ( LTG 200 ) or withdrew completely due to adverse experiences , 10.3 % versus 4.3 % ( LTG 100 ) and 4.5 % ( LTG 200 ) . The most common adverse experience leading to withdrawal was rash , with approximately double the proportion of reports occurring in patients on CBZ 600 ( 5.1 % ) compared with lamotrigine ( 1.7 % on LTG 100 and 2.7 % on LTG 200 ) . Overall lamotrigine appeared equally effective but better tolerated compared with carbamazepine .
