A double-blind crossover comparison of pindolol , metoprolol , atenolol and labetalol in mild to moderate hypertension . 1 This study was designed to compare in a double-blind randomized crossover trial , atenolol , labetalol , metoprolol and pindolol . Considerable differences in dose ( atenolol 138 +/- 13 mg daily ; labetalol 308 +/- 34 mg daily ; metoprolol 234 +/- 22 mg daily ; and pindolol 24 +/-2 mg daily were required to produce similar antihypertensive effects . 3 The overall incidence of side-effects was similar with atenolol , metoprolol and pindolol but was slightly less with labetalol . Sleep disturbances and abnormal dreaming patterns were most frequent with pindolol . 4 There was a significantly greater fall in pulse rate during atenolol and metoprolol treatment periods .

Pre-operative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation for patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery . The role of pre-operative short-term pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been assessed for the first time prospectively . Forty-five patients posted for coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomised to receive either short-term pulmonary rehabilitation ( group I ) or no such programme ( group II ) . Patients of both the groups were evenly matched with respect to age , sex , body surface area , duration and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease . Normal individuals who evenly matched with the study group were assessed for normal respiratory function parameters . Pre-operative and post-operative peak expiratory flow rate , inspiratory capacity , post-operative ventilation time , post-operative pulmonary complication and hospital stay were determined in both the groups . Peak expiratory flow rate ( 220.0 +/- 12.9 and 324.3 +/- 84.3 in group I , 218.0 +/- 16.4 and 260.5 +/- 35.2 in group II ) and inspiratory capacity ( 844.0 +/- 147.4 and 1100.0 +/- 158.1 in group I , 830.0 +/- 117.4 and 1090 +/- 137 in group II ) were significantly lower before and after surgery respectively in both groups compared to normal values . Even though both groups showed a significant rise in post-operative peak expiratory flow rate and inspiratory capacity after surgery , the post-operative peak expiratory flow rate and inspiratory capacity in group I was significantly higher than in group II . In group I , the post-operative ventilation time ( 24.5 +/- 6.00 hours ) , post-operative complications ( n = 4 ) and hospital stay ( 12.4 +/- 3.6 days ) were significantly lower than in group II ( 35.2 +/- 22.3 hours , n = 11 , 18.8 +/- 6.6 days respectively ) . These data suggest that short-term pulmonary rehabilitation is feasible and effective in improving pulmonary functions before and after surgery and in reducing surgical morbidity and cost of medical care significantly .
